# Threading Model

OWT QUIC SDK provides thread safe APIs, but object's creation and deletion must be called on the same thread. Objects are usually created by `WebTransportFactory`.

## Internals

There are two threads maintained internally:

- `io_thread`: Calls to Chromium's QUIC implementation are delegated to this thread.
- `event_thread`: Callbacks and events are fired on this thread. We may move to sequence later.

These two threads are owned by `WebTransportFactory`. Basically, all objects created by `WebTransportFactory` re-use the same task queues based on the two threads above.
